A partial list of things that don't work or are in need of enhancement:

1) Unit tests - there are none! The test/ directory has the beginnings of some
2) I am still working on doxygen-ifying the source
3) The CPU clock timing code is useless in its present form
4) The assembler/parser code is in bad need of refactoring
5) Various @todos need to be addressed.
