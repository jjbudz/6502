This is a 6502 emulator that I wrote back in the 90s and have been trying to clean up a bit. It is not complete but supports basic assembly, execution, and debugging. See the TODO file and the source for a full list of items needing to be completed.

The software builds on both Windows and MacOS. See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) file for instructions.

See the [CHEATSHEET](CHEATSHEET.md) for usage instructions.

Warning: this program is under development and has only been lightly tested. The unit test set is quite incomplete.
