A partial list of things that don't work or are in need of enhancement:

1. Unit tests - there are none! The test/ directory has the beginnings of some
1. I am still working on doxygen-ifying the source
1. The CPU clock timing code is useless in its present form
1. The assembler/parser code is in bad need of refactoring
1. Various @todos need to be addressed.
