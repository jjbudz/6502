unit tests for instructions (separate file and set of test programs) 

fix the assembler hacks for branching/jumps by adding instruction lengths to inst maps (see bytes struct member) 

assembler should understand addressing mode syntax 

need to add comments for instructions and what addressing modes they map to 

assembler should symbolic instruction names to the actual names for the addr mode in question 

implement zero page opcodes (?) 

add header comment block 

add external interfaces (load, save, assemble, run) and associated header 

create separate command line program main 

add assertions to ftrace to insure it does not assert at run time 

add register/address assertion functions/macros for use in unit tests 

establish clear function naming conventions (Uppercase external, lowercase internal?) 

fix doxygen comments 

provide automake build files for windows (32,64), linux (32,64), macos (32,64) 

document assembler syntax or create program option to dump opcode table and associate docs with each defined macro 

generate docs 

make it compatible with existing assembler source 

review function naming conventions for ext vs int use 

switch to native endian address/value storage (least) 

using short as an address is problematic because only 32k can be addressed 

would like to see the instruction set/assembler docs generated by doxy
