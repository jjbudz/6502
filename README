This is a 6502 emulator that I wrote back in the 90s and have been trying to clean up a bit. It is not complete but supports basic assembly, execution, and debugging. See the TODO file and the source for a full list of items needing to be completed.

The software is packaged for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and requires that to build.
